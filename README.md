# Melbourne-Seats-And-Population

When running a business, one of the most common dilemma business owners run into is deciding on the number of seats. Seating gives people a stopping point, whether it be for lunch, for a rest, a place to wait and meet others or simply a place to sit and take in the scenery. Therefore, my visualisation is focused on analysing and understanding the trend in number of seats in Melbourne and how population plays a greater role in determining the proportion of seats.  

The important question that every decision maker will have when establishing a business is “How many seats would be the optimal number of seats for the business?”. Hence, this visualisation will aid decision makers to acquire profound understanding on the optimal number of seats they should consider having based on looking at the trends in the number of seats of each industry and also demographic composition in the area where the industry thrives.

I collected two datasets: Seats dataset, which consists of the number of seats in each Melbourne areas and Industries and Population dataset, which consists of total population by age and gender in each Melbourne area. To further understand the trends in the number of seats over the years, I thought it will be useful to have population data given that with larger population in a particular area, higher number of seats are required to accommodate the large population. I merged these two datasets using R, and cleansed the file by removing information that are irrelevant for this visualisation. The final merged file is then used in tableau to create my visualisation.
